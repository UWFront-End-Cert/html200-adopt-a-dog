Lesson 10 Part 2- Testing
Testing and Cross-Browser Compatibility

Overview: Ensuring that the website functions seamlessly across different browsers and platforms is essential to provide a consistent and user-friendly experience for all visitors in search of their four-legged friend. I conducted thorough testing to identify and address any compatibility issues, some minor adjustments are needed and noted, to ensure optimal performance across a wide range of environments.

Testing Process

1. Browser Testing:
I tested the website on three web browsers: Google Chrome, Mozilla Firefox, and Microsoft Edge. This browser testing allowed me to identify any browser-specific issues and ensure a consistent look and functionality.

2. Mobile Responsiveness
I conducted tests via Google Chrome Developer and tested responsiveness on various simulated mobile devices, such as smartphones and tablets, with different screen sizes and orientations. This helped me verify that the website maintains its responsiveness and usability on smaller screens. There were some findings during this process and additional coding needed as mentioned below. 

Additional responsiveness needed:
•	Placement of the cart and checkout on the header is not ideal with smaller screen sizes and it should be made more responsive. 
•	The blog page has issues when it is converted on a smaller screen size. The images need to be made more responsive. At this time when the screen size becomes smaller, the text does not wrap and the images become miniature. 

3. Operating Systems
The testing covered different operating systems, including Windows, iOS, and Android. This step ensured that the website performs well and remains visually appealing across various platforms.

4. Accessibility Testing:
I performed accessibility testing to ensure that the website adheres to web accessibility guidelines (WCAG). This includes testing with screen readers, keyboard navigation, and ensuring proper color contrast for visually impaired users. Some improvements should be made to the accessibility of the site; such as improved keyboard navigation, and screen reader text expanded upon.
