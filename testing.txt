I tested on Firefox, Chrome and Safari on a Mac laptop by manually resizing the window and using the phone/tablet emulator tool on Firefox and Chrome. I also tested using a PC and an android phone.


Things that I have adjusted:
 - I adjusted the flexbox and added padding-right to the cart icon and total price in the upper right corner to keep it fully on the screen when resized on all page widths.

 - Added padding-right to the checkout button to keep it from running into the screen edge on resize

 - Added 0.5rem padding on the right and left for the header nav buttons in my media queries to keep proper spacing on smaller screens.


Items changed with media queries below 768px:

.header-flex padding-right set to 0
.home-intro padding set to 2rem for top and bottom, 0 for left and right
.home-intro changed row-gap to 1rem
I set the gap to 0 for the main grid container to remove side scroll
I added a media query so that the blog images on the blog page would span the same distance as the text
I set the width for the submit button on the checkout page to 100%. 



Bugs that have not been fixed yet:
 - On blog page, on a screen size 768px up to 1343px the texts are wider than the images.
 - Print preview has problems on every page.
