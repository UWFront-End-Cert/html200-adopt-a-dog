Testing
------------------------------------------------------------
DEVICE TESTING
Device testing for this site was done using developer tools on Firefox. To be accurate with the testing, 
it was also loaded on an iPhone X, iPhone 7, and Samsung Galaxy A32.
Tablet testing was done using an iPad mini as well as an iPad 4th gen.

WEB BROWSER/OPERATING SYSTEM TESTING
The website was tested using Microsoft Edge, Firefox, and Google Chrome. 
Testing was done on Windows 10 and macOS Monterey.

I verified that images and text were aligned on multiple different sizes of screens as well as working properly 
on different operating systems. Confirmed that everything was readable and scaled properly. There were some issues 
with the grid layout during testing but should have been fixed. Also made sure that the hover effects on the dog 
information cards did not effect readability.
